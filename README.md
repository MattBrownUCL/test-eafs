# test-eafs
Does some sanity checking on a collection of ELAN EAFs. 

Copy your EAF files/folders into a folder called 'input' in the same location as the script. This folder will be searched recursively for any EAF files.

The script checks to see if every EAF has the same number of tiers, and if every tier is found in the same number of EAFs. 

Dumps findings to two CSV files.
